    "### Overview: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, I will use a dataset of 2000+ songs from Spotify and I will analyze how positive (i.e. happy, cheerful, upbeat) a list of songs created with an inputted tempo are. That is, given a tempo (in beats per minute), this program will plot the valences (a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness) in a scatter plot of a list of songs with tempos greater than or equal to the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key to this plot is a measure of happiness called valence, which is defined as follows:\n",
    "##### Valence (float) - A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). This measure is generated by Spotify algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important definition is the tempo:\n",
    "##### Tempo (float) - The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was compelted as part of a course at UBC called \"Introduction to Systematic Program Design\". In this course, we learned the basics of Python and how to understand and design well fucntoning programs. This is my first project with Python, but I guarrantee it won't be my last!\n",
    "\n",
    "As to why I chose this project, the answer is easy: I love music. I'm always lookign for new artists, heading to local concerts, and heading to Genius.com to learn the meaning behind lyrics. This project gave me the chance to dive into aduio qualities of songs from a public dataset from Spotify. \n",
    "\n",
    "The details of this program can be found in the repository and I've attached the csv files I used for analysis."

    "\n",
    "In this program, I needed to use everything we learned in this class to systimatically break down my data set and apprpriately display it. I needed to decide the best way to present the information, notably answering the question \"How would I organize my x axis?\". For this example, I ultimately made the decision to use a categorical variable in a scatter plot, which is something I had to learn by reading the documentation of matplotlib.\n",
